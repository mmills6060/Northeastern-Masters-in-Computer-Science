Reflection:

I certainly learned a lot in this project. This week, I was definitely not excpecting to have already existing code that I would have to manipulate in a way to make it better. In other words, I wasn't expecting to simulate code that already works to a certain extent, and have to add functionality to it. I suppose that this is a really great way to simulate what it may be like in a real professional environment, where almost always I will be working on and improving already existing code. I also think it is very interesting to have to implement code in a very specific way. I implemented the code in maybe 30 minutes in a different way than described, and spent much longer trying to figure out how to do it the way it was instructed.

I believe that the main difference between the tree traversal that I used today and the bst example is the fact that the value of each node doesn't really matter. The tree traversal will just blindly traverse through the tree in order to access various pieces of information.
