I thought that this was a great project. I learned a lot in this project. First of all, I grew more comfortable with linked lists and how to inherit them. I also grew more comfortable with interfaces. I felt as if I was much more comfortable working with classes and ensuring that each class is interacting with all of the other classes properly. 

I think for this project, a linked list makes sense because the sentences are basically a collection of nodes that form a sentence. Theres really no reason to take away the order of the words because then the sentence just wouldn't make any sense. For this reason, I can see why a linked list is a good option. 

This could definitely be implemented without a linked list. I think an array would also make sense. It isn't really necessary to be able to navigate to a specific word within a sentence, but it's still possible and it could work. Something like a stack or queue could probably work but would be weird to implement. I don't know if it's possible to do a binary tree.
