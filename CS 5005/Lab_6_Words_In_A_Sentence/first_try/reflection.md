Personally, I thought that this was one of the easiest labs that we have done so far. I thought this was all a good basic refresher of a lot of major concepts in Java. I have certainly grown even more comfortable with the concept of object oriented programming. Creating classes and mentally thinking about how each class interacts with each other has become second nature to me. I did not run in to any problems when completing this project.
