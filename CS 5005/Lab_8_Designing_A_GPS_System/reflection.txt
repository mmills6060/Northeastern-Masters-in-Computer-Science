what did you learn that you were not expecting to in doing this project?

In this project, I really had no idea how you could calculate the distance between two points using latitude and longitude. This is super interesting, especially since the earth is curved. 


how did the required MVC design change your approach to building a program? did it help or did it make things more difficult?

the MVC design comnpletely changeed my approach. Rather than worrying about what is inheriting what and what should be a separate file and what shouldn't, my overall 
approach was to think about what part of the program am I writing right now. Am I writing something that will be presented to the user or is this backend logic that is used to 
manage data in some way. I like this approach much better. It makes things much neater and easier to read and manage. I think MVC would be a good approach especially as things scale.
It would probably lead to more spaghetti code but I would honestly prefer spaghetti code over a million different files. 

do you have any questions about MVC?

I don't have any questions about MVC.
