what did you learn that you were not expecting to in doing this project?

one thing that I learned is how to calculate the distance between two points given the coordinates. I had
absolutely no clue how to do that before this project.

how did the required MVC design change your approach to building a program? did it help or did it make things more difficult?

do you have any questions baout MVC?
