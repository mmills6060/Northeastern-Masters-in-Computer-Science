creates a class resource

This class holds constant variables I will want 
to use throughout my application. Need to make sure the 
variables can be inherited from

All of the variables should be accessible from outside
and unchangeable

inside this class, I need to create constants for the weight of a stone
block and the weight of a wood block. Suggested weights 
to match the driver prototype are Stone 20.0 and Wood 10.0
but you may choose your own weights. 

make sure to use the correct naming conversion.
