# Northeastern-Masters-in-Computer-Science
This is a repository of all of the code that I have written and will write in the coming years during the completion of my Masters in Computer Science. This program is specifically the Masters in Computer Science Align program, which essentially includes all of the foudational courses from an Undergraduate degree. This program is meant for students that don't necessarily have a computer science background, and wish to get into the tech industry.
# CS 5001: Intensive Foundations of Computer Science
Introduces systematic problem solving through programming. Offers students an opportunity to learn how to analyze a problem, how to divide and organize the problem into appropriate components, how to describe the problem in a computer language, how to analyze and understand the behavior of their programs, and how to test that their programs are working correctly. Additionally, introduces a method of program design called object-oriented programming and various ways to organize data, including a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. To practice the course concepts, students undertake assignments ranging from small, highly specified programming tasks to larger open-ended problems where students design and code their own solutions.
# CS 5002: Discrete Structures
Introduces the mathematical structures and methods that form the foundation of computer science. Studies structures such as sets, tuples, sequences, lists, trees, and graphs. Discusses functions, relations, ordering, and equivalence relations. Examines inductive and recursive definitions of structures and functions. Covers principles of proof such as truth tables, inductive proof, and basic logic and the counting techniques and arguments needed to estimate the size of sets, the growth of functions, and the space-time complexity of algorithms. Also, discusses data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, lists, and the algorithms that manipulate them.
# CS 5003: Recitation for Intensive Foundations of Computer Science
Provides a small-group discussion format to cover material in CS 5001.
