# An example of an arithmetic expression

x = 25          # a statement
x = x + 10      # an expression

print(x)

# write a few lines of code that assigns the value 7 to the variable x. 
# Furthermore, write an expression that includes the modulo operator

x = 7          # a statement
x = x % 2      # an expression

print(x)
