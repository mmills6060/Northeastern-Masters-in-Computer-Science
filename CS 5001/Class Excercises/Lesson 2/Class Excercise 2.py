#Challenge the hello world program so that each of the strings are variables 
def main():
    hello = str("Hello ")
    world = str("World ")
        
    print(hello+world)


#Now make a new variable that holds your name

    myname = str("Michael")
    
#Use these variables to make the program print “Hello World” and “Hello Myname”
    print(hello+world+myname)

#Write a new program that imitates a 3 year old. Have it print out “why? A number of times using the * operated for stirngs 
    num_why = int(input("How many why's? --> "))
    print("why?" * num_why)
