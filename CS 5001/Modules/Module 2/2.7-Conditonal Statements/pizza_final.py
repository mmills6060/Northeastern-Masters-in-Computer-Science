This program calculates the number of slices each person can eat
when n pizzas are ordered.

This is the program we ended with in Lesson 3-2.

def main():
    # get two integers from the user
    pizzas = int(input("How many pizzas did you order? "))
    people = int(input("How many people are there? "))
    if people != 0:
        # multiply by 8 slices per pie and divide
        slices = pizzas * 8 / people
        print(pizzas, "pizzas split between",
              people, "can have", slices, "slices")
    else:
        print("people cannot be 0")
