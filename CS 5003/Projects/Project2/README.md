
**Problem Description**

In this project, we are asked to complete three python algorithms. These algorithms primarily help us practice creating flowcharts and implement code based on our flowchart. Additionally, this project helps us practice nesting statements. In the first program, we ask the user to provide three numbers, and find the maximum and minimum of the numbers as well as the average. In the second algorithm, the user is asked to provide four words. The words are then sorted alphabetically. In the third algorithm, the user is asked to provide a date. The season of the input date is then provided.

**Required Elements**

Theenumbers.py-

I thought this was an important algorithm to start with. It allowed me to get a feel for nesting if and else statements. I was also intrigued with the fact that I was able to determine the minimum and the maximum without creating an entirely new branch on the decision tree. In my first attempt at creating this algorithm, I immediately went to the min max functions as a solution. It really made me appreciative of the functionality embedded in the python programming language.

Alphabetize.py-

This was by far the most complicated algorithm to write. I was originally thinking, "am I crazy or am I seriously about to write out an algorithm with 24 different instances?" Again, I became incredibly appreciative with some of the Python functionality such as the "sort" method, which could achieve the same exact result with two lines of code.

Seasons.py-

I attempted this project before our lab, and was particularly stumped with how we could extract a season out of ANY date provided from the user. It never occurred to me that the best way to do this is to use a string split function to extract just the month from the input date. I found this particularly fascinating as it had never occurred to me that this would be the best solution.

**Reflection**

One of the most important things I learned in this project is how important it can be to properly organize my code with flow charts and diagrams. I don't know how I could possibly write the algorithm for seasons.py without referring to the flow chart that I had created. I learned the importance of breaking down a complex problem into little pieces with both the flow chart and the code itself via comments.
