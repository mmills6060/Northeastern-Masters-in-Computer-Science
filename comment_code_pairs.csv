# Split the data into training and validation sets,"train_comments, val_comments, train_code, val_code = train_test_split(comments, code, test_size=0.2)"
# Convert to TensorFlow datasets,"train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_comments, train_code))

# Example: Processing a batch of data,"for comment_batch, code_batch in train_dataset.batch(3).take(1):
