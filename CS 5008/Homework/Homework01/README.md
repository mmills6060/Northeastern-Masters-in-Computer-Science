How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 
.5
Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.  
- one per row, add more if needed


Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)  
- one row per resource


(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
it is always fun playing around with linux distrbutions. it can turn into a big rabbit hole. 
(Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 

## Learning Questions

* In C, do you use printf or print? 
printf
* What operating system do you use? 
All of them, depending on what I am interested in doing. For this project I used a arch based linux distribution called Artix Linux. I also migrated over to windows halfway through.  
* What did you end up doing to get C working on your system?
I installed clang. I already have the necessary packages installed in visual studio. 
* Markdown is a common standard to format text, particularly due to the popularity of github. Take a moment to review a github guide or two, and then write a few basic examples of markdown in the 'markdown playground' section below. You need to include both code and some formatting content on the examples. Make sure to view this readme in browser (your github repo) to see how it renders. 

* Computer science ends up becoming more "exploration" based as you progress. This assignment required a lot of exploration and learning the correct thing to setup / install - which is all unique based on your systems. This is common in the industry, even if it can be frustrating for a student just learning. 
   * Reflect a bit on why that would be the case for computer science? Include in your reflection some "habits" you can develop to help better that process of exploration and learning. Please include at least a paragraph for this reflection.

   There are constantly new things coming out in the realm of computer science, and it is a quickly growing field, and to staying on top of the latest and greatest technology requires a tremendous amount of time and effort. I think it is always a good habit to look and see what type of prerequisites are required in order to accomplish the task.
