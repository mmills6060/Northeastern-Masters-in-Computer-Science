## BST Questions

1. Given a *balanced* and *full* Binary Search Tree, what is the Big O for finding a value in the tree?
balanced = O(log n)
full = O(log n)
2. Define balanced in relation to BSTs. Remember to relate it to height.
balanced means that the height of the tree is the same, if not different by 1 
3. What is the Worst Case Big O for searching or adding to a BST?
O(n)
   * What type of BST would this be? (how would it look)
   this would be an unbalanced tree
4. What are some of the advantages of a BST over a linked list?
it is faster (referencing time complexity)
5. What are some cases / examples of when you would use a BST?
BST's would be good for when we are looking to find the minimum and maximum of something. It would also be good if the tree is constantly being updated.
