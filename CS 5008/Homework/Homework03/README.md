## Further Thinking Questions

1. What are some cases you would use a stack?
in a text editor or in microsoft word, when the program has to remember changes, so when the user would like to undo or redo changes, it is able to do so through stack. 
2. What are some cases you would use a queue?
when a server takes in requests from hundreds of users, and processes those requests. The requests obviously take time, and it wouldnt be fair to have the server complete the most recent request first (stack). alternatively we can have a queue of tasks that are executed so the users who have been waiting the longest to have their task completed will have their task completed first. 
3. Why is a linked list useful for implementing a stack? In your reply, consider if a stack was implemented with an array, and the values kept getting added to the front of the area, what would you have to do?
a linked list is useful because there is a current head of the list, and this head can be updated. The last item added to the stack is also the only item that can be removed, and this correlates with the head of the list. 
4. Adding to the end of a singly linked list is expensive, because you have to cycle through the whole list. What is one thing you could change that would make adding to the end just as easy as adding to the front?
There might be a few ways to do this. One of which would be to have a linked list that is not "singly." in other words there are two pointers attached to each node, one for the next node and one for the previous node. I also think that we could also add a pointer to a pointer...
5. Thinking about memory, what is the difference between an array and a linked list? What is the advantage of each?
an array can hold a fixed number of elements that contain a an index, or number to identify each element. Because each element contains an index, it is easy to access the elements. The one problem with an array is that when an element is either inserted or removed, it will be very costly because it all of the indexes of each element need to be changed. 

in contrast, a linked list is essentially a group of nodes. within these nodes cotains the data element as well as a pointer to the next node in the list. Becuase of this, insertion and deletion is easy. 


## Reflection

There is a ton of research directly relating reflection to performance in Computer Science. The research has even gone as far as to show that reflection helps with job interviews and future promotions. Every few homeworks (and the midterm) we are going to have you write a reflection. When you write a reflection, you should focus on these key points (it should be a few paragraphs). DO NOT just bullet point your answer! This is counter productive! Instead, construct your answer into a proper paragraphs. 

1. Write a brief summary of the key learning points from this class, what you learned, both in and out of class.
The key learning points of this project was to experiment with stacks and queues and how they work. We learned about how to manipulate stacks and queues and what some of the advantages and disadvantages are for these different types of data structures.
2. Discuss how you feel about the usefulness and challenges in this class.
   * What was challenging for you?
   the most challenging part for me was conceptualizing exactly what is happening, and what the expected outcome should be for each individual function. 
   * What did you enjoy the most?
   I enjoyed learning about pointers. I already had a good understanding of the various data structures, but adding the concept of pointers to the initialization of various data structures was fun to learn.
   * Can you apply your learning directly now or in the future?
   This is actually a question that I have been pondering recently. I would love to find out what are some real world scenarious where it is actually useful to handle memory manually. 
3. Discuss how you can make future experiences in this area even more valuable. What are your social, personal and intellectual goals in this area?
   * How can you further expand upon your skills?
   I am very interested in learning more about pointers and why it is important. Why do we need pointers and manual memory management. I want to learn about pointers of pointers. I want to expand on what is considered to be good practice for implemeneting memory management. Ultimately, memory management is my number one priority in terms of a skill that I am looking to improve.   
   * What do you need to do to improve study habits?
   I think I have relatively good study habits. If anything, sometimes I go down a deep rabbit hole, and come out realizing that I havent finished the initial project. For example, it is really easy to go down a deep rabbit hole when experimenting with linux distributions. But what is actually graded is the project itself, not what fancy compiler is being used. 
   * What areas do you need to work specifically related to coding?
   I have a habit of constantly running code to see if it runs successfully. I know this it is preached to do this, but I feel like I do this too much. I feel like I rely on the fact that I can just check to see if it runs rather than using my own brain. It's not that I don't understand the material, It's just that I sometimes prefer to not use my brain and just see if it runs. This is probably a bad idea. 
For this reflection, we encourage you to focus on challenges, study habits, and ways you can improve.
