How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.  
- one per row, add more if needed


Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)  
- one row per resource


(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 

## Further Thinking Questions

1. What are some cases you would use a stack?
2. What are some cases you would use a queue?
3. Why is a linked list useful for implementing a stack? In your reply, consider if a stack was implemented with an array, and the values kept getting added to the front of the area, what would you have to do?
4. Adding to the end of a singly linked list is expensive, because you have to cycle through the whole list. What is one thing you could change that would make adding to the end just as easy as adding to the front?
5. Thinking about memory, what is the difference between an array and a linked list? What is the advantage of each?



## Reflection

There is a ton of research directly relating reflection to performance in Computer Science. The research has even gone as far as to show that reflection helps with job interviews and future promotions. Every few homeworks (and the midterm) we are going to have you write a reflection. When you write a reflection, you should focus on these key points (it should be a few paragraphs). DO NOT just bullet point your answer! This is counter productive! Instead, construct your answer into a proper paragraphs. 

1. Write a brief summary of the key learning points from this class, what you learned, both in and out of class.
2. Discuss how you feel about the usefulness and challenges in this class.
   * What was challenging for you?
   * What did you enjoy the most?
   * Can you apply your learning directly now or in the future?
3. Discuss how you can make future experiences in this area even more valuable. What are your social, personal and intellectual goals in this area?
   * How can you further expand upon your skills?
   * What do you need to do to improve study habits?
   * What areas do you need to work specifically related to coding?

For this reflection, we encourage you to focus on challenges, study habits, and ways you can improve.
