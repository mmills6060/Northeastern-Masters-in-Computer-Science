## Questions

1. Add a markdown table demonstrating the in practice time for Hashmaps. 
2. What is the worst case time for a hashmap, even if rare, can you come up with a condition that always generates worst case?
3. Looking back at the Team Activity 09, how often did you see collisions from the various data sizes? (go ahead and copy/paste the output from the activity)
4. To make this hashmap fully usable - what are some functions missing that should be implemented? (props if you implement them!)
   * if you are stuck, think about how would someone get all the names of the food items, if they are doing inventory?
5. How can hashmaps help you with dynamic programming? Are they effective mechanisms for caches?
