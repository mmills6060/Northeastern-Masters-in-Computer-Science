Note the following is an example outline to help you. Please rework as you need. 

## Introduction
- What is the algorithm/datastructure?
- What is the problem it solves? 
- Provide a brief history of the algorithm/datastructure. (make sure to cite sources)
- Provide an introduction to the rest of the paper. 


## Analysis of Algorithm/Datastructure
Make sure to include the following:
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- General analysis of the algorithm/datastructure

## Empirical Analysis
- What is the empirical analysis?
- Provide specific examples / data.


## Application
- What is the algorithm/datastructure used for?
- Provide specific examples
- Why is it useful / used in that field area?
- Make sure to provide sources for your information.


## Implementation
- What language did you use?
- What libraries did you use?
- What were the challenges you faced?
- Provide key points of the algorithm/datastructure implementation, discuss the code.
- If you found code in another language, and then implemented in your own language that is fine - but make sure to document that.


## Summary
- Provide a summary of your findings
- What did you learn?
