# Summative Research Project / Technical Report

For this assignment, you will be researching an algorithm or data structure not covered in the course. 
You will be writing a report on the algorithm or data structure, and 
you will be implementing it in **a programming language of your choice**. You will be presenting your 
research and implementation as part of the repository submission. 

## Deliverables:
* The report should be written in markdown, and as your [README.md](../README.md) file for the repository. 
* All code written should be provided
* Tests for code should be provided
* Any related files and evidence of running the algorithm/datastructure should be provided. For example: you capture the output of your run into text files. 

From your deliverables, we should not only be able to see a valid implementation, but that you confirmed and fully
tested it in addition to the report.

## Details:

This is an open ended research project with the condition it must be an algorithm or data structure not covered in the course.
With that said, it can be difficult to select a topic. Here are some suggestions:

* B+ Trees
* AVL Tree
* Heap Data Structure (if you do this, make sure you include a comparison of implementations)
* Cartesian Tree
* R+ Tree
* Red‚Äìblack tree
* Sorted Hashmap
* (Really, you can look at the java collections interface and get a bunch of ideas of what to implement)

For some algorithms, you may want to consider implementing a specific algorithm, or a specific type of algorithm.

* KnapSack 
* Lagged Fibonacci generator (or other Pseudorandom number generator)
* Ford‚ÄìFulkerson algorithm (flow networks)
* Minimum Spanning Tree
* Best First Search
* Jump Point Search
* Tim Sort
* A* Search Algorithm
* Trigram Search
* Collision Detection
* Line Segment Intersection
* Minimum Bounding Box 
* Alpha-beta pruning (or just minimax)
* Ant Colony


Here are some overly broad topic lists.

### Selection Guidelines

It is easy to select something either too large or too small. The balance is if you end up doing a lot of coding, we will 
look more at the code than the report. But if your coding is relatively simple (as single function with a few test
cases), then we will expect a more detailed report/research surrounding it. 

Part of programming is often researching the best way to do something. For this assignment, you will be demonstrating your ability
to research and implement an algorithm or data structure.  

**IMPORTANT** You must implement the algorithm yourself. For example, you cannot use Java's Sorted Hashmap and say you implemented it by testing it. You could look at Java's SortedHashmap since the code is freely available, and then implement your own version of it in another language that is fine. 


> Feel free to reach out to ask if something is of the appropriate size! Also feel free to talk about algorithms or data structures in the general channel on MS Teams!! Asking questions about your data structure / algorithm will help others. 

## Empirical Analysis

You will be providing a detailed analysis of the algorithm or data structure. However, it can also be very difficult to figure out the best way to analyze an algorithm or data structure. We have already shown using HW05 and the Midterm comparison analysis by looking at the speed between algorithms or the speed between various implementations of the same algorithm. 

During your team activities, you have also look at collisions for hash functions, and used that as a means to compare hash functions. There are other ways to look at an analysis also, including documenting the running of the algorithm itself. For example, adding a large number of items to an AVL, and then documenting how many swaps are needed to keep it balanced, and then comparing those swaps to the number of searches operations.  Another way is to show the efficiency of the algorithm given a certain dataset size, and then discuss its scalability. For some algorithms, you will find are good at smaller sizes, but they fall into a category called NP or NP-Complete at higher levels. That is fine! You do not need to be trying to solve it for the large cases (those are actually very difficult to solve - and the heart of the discussion in 5800: P vs NP).

We are sure that you can come up with other means such as graphs, visualizations, and more, but the important part is that you are telling us the 'story' behind it in a data driven way. It needs to help you understand the algorithm, and help the reader better understand the algorithm.  Yes, an online webpage can be a visualization (if you make one). If you do that, make sure you include it in your report / or at least screen shots of it running. We would consider that part of the analysis even if it isn't an analysis in the traditional sense.

> We suggest you think about this *BEFORE* you implement the algorithm and feel free to ask for ideas. 

## üìù Grading Rubric

You will submit your project as a link to your repository on Canvas. Your repository should contain all of the deliverables listed above, and it needs to be in the github classroom repo that is generated from the github classroom link. This will give TAs full access to the project without needing to make it public. 

The rubric will be as follows.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Code Quality** | Code is written correctly, based on the language norms including memory management and small concise functions. Tests included to show validity. Sample runs included. | Code is both documented and test files included. | Code exists, is documented OR tested by including test files for all the code. | Code exists but is not documented or tested. Or it is evident code does not run correctly. | No code or evident it cannot compile. |    
| **Writing / Grammar** | Report is easy to read, follows proper formatting guidelines, matches correct audience. | Report uses grammar at a college level. | Difficult to read due to poor sentence structures and wording choices. | Difficult to read.

Total Points: 28

Please note: As we better refine the rubric, it may be updated on wording. Double check the wording in canvas before submission as that is the most accurate version.
